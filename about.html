				<h3>~ My Adult Journey, where I experimented with paths out of
					high school:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Initially decided not to go to college, was
						influenced by Peter Thiel and
						<a

							>this Nathaniel Drew video</a
						>. I wanted to take a gap year so I convinced my
						parents.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tried producing music.
					</li>
					<li>Basically got my real estate license.</li>
					<li>
						Tried college, thinking I could
						upgrade to a better school quickly.
					</li>
					<li>
						Learned more about software, dropped out after a
						semester.
					</li>
					<li>
						Learned programming online (Angela Yu = goat). 
						Decided with my parents
						that more learning structure would be good, I researched options.
					</li>
					<li>
						Found App Academy, a coding bootcamp. Applied and got in (5% acceptance).
					</li>
					<li>
						Flew to San Francisco, lived there for 4 months in a
						co-living, made some friends while attending school,
						graduated, and flew home.
					</li>
					<li>
						Polished portfolio projects and job
						materials, which brings us to the present, finishing
						DS+A studies and looking for a job.
					</li>
				</ul>
