				<h1>Hi I'm Adam Pangelinan. I write songs, essays, and code.</h1>

				<h3>~ Personal</h3>
				<p>
					I'm a 21 year old guy from Guam, USA. I like philosophy, coding, kpop, startups, music, books, etc. 
				</p>

				<h3>~ Profession</h3>
				<p>
					Experimented with different career paths out of highschool, I didn't want to go to college. Was very influenced in this decision by Peter Thiel and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knj9Atxscrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this YouTube video by Nathaniel Drew</a>. I thought I'd try a gap year so I convinced my parents. I tried producing music, basically got my real estate license, decided to try traditional college for a semester (thinking I could quickly upgrade to a better school if I got good grades but something stopped this path...), learned about the coding path further (I knew a bit from highschool and I took a robotics class so I was a bit familiar), decided to drop out, tried self-teaching, decided with my parents that a more structured learning environment could be benefitial so I started to research options, found App Academy, applied, got in, and now I'm here, finishing my DS+A studies and looking for a remote job.
