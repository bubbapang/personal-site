            <h1>Architects and Gardeners : November 11th, 2022</h1>

            <h3>~ Introduction</h3>
            <p>There are apparently two types of fiction writers: architects and gardeners. Architects make plot outlines and thrive on writing with structure. Gardeners create full characters and personalities, plop them into a universe, and see what the characters would do, but don’t necessarily know what the end plot would look like.</p>

            <h3>~ Applying to Our Lives</h3>
            <p>I think these two styles can be applied to living our own lives. We all set goals for ourselves and live in structure, just like an architect would write a plot. We also all live like gardeners: exploring, progressing, living day-to-day, and seeing what happens next (living serendipitously).</p>

            <h3>~ My Approach</h3>
            <p>I’ve found that balancing architecture and gardening into a flexible structure of a strategy has been optimal for me, so I’m writing this essay to share.</p>
