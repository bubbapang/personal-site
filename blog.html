    <h1>Architects and Gardeners : November 11th, 2022</h1>
    There are apparently two types of fiction writers: architects and gardeners. <br>
    Architects make plot outlines and thrive on writing with structure. <br>
    Gardeners create full characters and personalities, plop them into a universe, <br>
    and see what the characters would do, but don’t necessarily know what the end plot <br>
    would look like. <br>
    <br>
    I think these two styles can be applied to living our own lives. <br>
    We all set goals for ourselves and live in structure, just like an architect would <br>
    write a plot. We also all live like gardeners: exploring, progressing, <br>
    living day-to-day, and seeing what happens next (living serendipitously).<br>
    <br>
    I’ve found that balancing architecture and gardening into a flexible structure of a <br>
    strategy has been optimal for me, so I’m writing this essay to share. <br>
